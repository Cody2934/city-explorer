// Create a route with a method of get and a path of /location. The route callback should invoke a function to convert the search query to a latitude and longitude. The function should use the provided JSON data.

// Return an object which contains the necessary information for correct client rendering. See the sample response.

// Confirm that your route is responding as expected by entering your deployed backend URL on the City Explorer app's welcome page. Then search for a location. You should see the map, but not any other data yet.
